# What is it?

OOP based terminal app to add employees to a fake database. For a learning purposes

Adding employee to your database (which is just a list), and showing the employees from the database. Unfortunatelly I couldn't handle removing employees or 
editing them since there's no real database or UI.. Purpose of this app is learning and it's properly commented (I guess) so somebody may find there help for himself.
